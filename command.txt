Create a user with user group
sudo useradd devops

Create two directories in user's home directory named os-concepts and ubuntu-is-the-best
mkdir os-concepts
mkdir os-concepts

Create two files on each directory
cd os-concepts/
touch file1.txt
touch file2.txt
cd ubuntu-is-the-best/
touch file3.txt
touch file4.txt

List the files with detailed information ( including file permission )
ls - l os-concepts
ls -l ubuntu-is-the-best

Update file permission so that owner can read,write and group can only read and others can not do anything
cd os-concepts/
chmod 640 file1.txt
chmod 640 file1.txt
cd ubuntu-is-the-best/
chmod 640 file3.txt
chmod 640 file4.txt

Create another group
sudo groupadd another_group

Update file ownership to the newly created group
sudo chown :another_group *.txt

Add the user to the new group
tail -3 /etc/group
sudo usermod pias-devops -g 1002

Create a file called crash.in ( File should contain the word crash in it ) in different directories and then find the file in all the locations using find command
echo "crash" > ~/devops/linux/os-concepts/crash.in
find ~/devops/linux/os-concepts -name "crash.in"

Then, replace the lines with crash to broken to all files ( use sed, xargs )
sed -i 's/crash/broken/g' crash.in
sed -i 's/crash/broken/g' crash.in
